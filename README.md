# Random Walk on Temporal Networks

Temporal networks are dynamic systems that capture the evolution of relationships or interactions over time. Unlike static networks, where connections remain constant, temporal networks incorporate the temporal dimension, 
acknowledging that relationships can change and evolve across different time points. This framework is essential for modeling and understanding various real-world phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, information flow, and dynamic social interactions, providing a more accurate representation of the intricate dynamics inherent in complex systems.

In a general context, a random walk is a mathematical concept representing a path formed by a series of random steps,
where each step is determined by chance rather than a predetermined direction. This concept is widely used in various fields, such as physics, finance, and computer science, to model processes ranging from particle movements to stock prices.

In the context of temporal networks, a temporal random walk extends this idea to dynamic systems where connections between nodes change over time. It involves a walker navigating through the network's evolving structure at each time step, moving from one node to another based on probabilistic rules. Temporal random walks are valuable for studying diffusion processes,
information spreading, and other dynamic phenomena in systems characterized by evolving relationships over time.

This code allows you to explore the dynamics of random walkers on temporal networks. This simulation has shor requirements: `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
